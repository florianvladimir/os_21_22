# OS Design Goals
Es müssen nicht immer alle erflüllt werden, aber man muss versuchen möglichts alles zu berücksichtigen

- Abstraction: The system should be easy and convenient to use; introducing abstractions enables this.
- Performance Overhead, both in space (memory/disk) and time (CPU), needs to be kept small
- Protection The OS, as well as individual programs require protection from each other. One of the main principles used here is isolation.
- Reliability When the operating system fails, all applications fail as well. An OS must be capable of running 24h/day.
- Security Protection against malicious programs, attackers. Can be considered as an extension of protection.
- Effciency Applies to various areas; with mobile and internet of things (IoT) devices, energy eciency is critical.
